# python-basic
I wrote those scripts as part of a course I took at Boston University, they include:
- String manipulation and regular expressions
- Database creation and basic querying
- Custom objects and multi-threading
- Read CSV into sqllite, use the included MLB2008.csv and StockValuations.csv
